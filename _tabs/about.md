**HEY THERE, HI THERE, HO THERE!!** Welcome to my blog!

This is meant to be a personal blog of sorts - and I sure hope it sticks around well this time!
I've tried starting personal blogs in the past, but they've never really stuck around long enough due to either having them on WordPress where I really could not seem to satisfied with the theme options long enough, or because hosting something like a Ghost blog on a private server is too much for me to handle.
This here, is probably the easiest blog I've managed to conjure and configure.. with not that many compromises!

I plan on using this space as like an open journal - well, to an extent.
I am a private hoot online irl, but I figure shedding some light on my own past experiences as self reflections would make it less likely to expose too much at a time.
I have a habit of making long posts back when I was more active on Facebook, but having moved my social habits to Twitter in recent years, 280 characters per post meant long threads which I don't think works with my long-winded thoughts.
And no, I don't intend on forking out US$8-11 to have my voice heard even louder on a platform whose big head honcho doesn't seem to know his ass from his elbow, hate to say it.

Expect past life experiences, some new and recent ones, probably a couple of vents (I'll try to control myself if that happens!), and possibly anything related to tutorials if I do feel like it myself!
I pride myself as someone who's really into education, and having taught for 2.5 years, I still really do urge for more!
Also, if you really know me irl, please don't expose me here.. this owl's begging you!
I hope that while maintaining a level of anonymity here, I am able to be as vulnerable and as truthful as possible in all of my posts.

Other than that, I do hope you enjoy your stay here.
Please take care, and this hoot wishes you well! ðŸ¦‰
