It's 4:13am as this post just started, and it's probably gonna kick me in the ass unless I decide to span typing this post out for a few days.
Anyway, here goes nothing, hopefully I can keep it short this time.

Of all the days I decided to scroll through a bit on my otherwise TOXIC Facebook feed, here's an article I found suggested to me by the Wall Street Journal: [What to Expect When You Reconnect With Friends in Person](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-reconnect-with-friends-in-person-as-the-pandemic-recedes-11622303940?reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&ref=localhost)

Now some thoughts - it's a great article, and I absolutely agree that for some people, this is a very good "How to Life" guide after we can party on maskless.
Okay, read my last sentence - for SOME people.
I for one am unable to get myself excited over being able to meet and greet people again once this blows over, and I'd say social media and consequently my family are to blame.
My social media habits have largely shifted since the end of 2020, and I just celebrated my birthday 2 days ago without anyone speaking a single word about the burning hell and the cabinet's nincompoop wannabes in power outside keeping us cooped in.
With how everyone seems to only know how to share distressing news about how many people got infected or kicked the bucket, or (so help me) how we're let down by a backdoor government who on the first day in power tried to assure us that they'd do everything they can to earn our trust..
I feel like there are just some people I'd rather stay away for my own good, away from their foul and ever-so-depressing words.
And especially those who seem to think it's a good conversation starter during these troubling times.

With that, here is my list of types of people I plan on cutting ties with altogether after the pandemic ends:

**ONE: Hecklers who can't stop talking about the bad news.**
I tried pruning my Facebook feed 3 times now to mute anyone who only uses social media to complain.
Between the pandemic and some poor decisions, the number of connections I had online who do that on a regular basis just amplified beyond 11.
To me, it just tells me that these people are uninterested in seeing the good side to life.
This is different from the critical thinkers I know who aren't whom I'd consider these sort of dumb opportunists - for one, if they share some thoughts they have and more beyond just simply making noisy literature, these are the people I don't mind having around in my life.
It's great to have our noggins working every once in a while and not be blind sheep - these people are not the same as those who only complain and choose to (often prematurely) judge people on the fly.
These are the one I will NEVER miss first and foremost.
You all should know better that what you post online can affect someone who reads it - I know I learnt this the painful way.

**TWO: The "justified" racists.**
Forget `#BlackLivesMatter` and all the distressing news pertaining to the minority in the West, we also have them here in the East.
I find my parents and a lot of the adult relatives in my family being partly to blame.
It's bad enough when you hear someone make racial slurs or diss the opposite gender to prove dominance, but when this becomes a cycle of events it's just utterly disgusting.
Here's an example I absolutely despise to this day:

> "Wah, 9020 cases today! Haiyaa, it's all because of the Malays simply go balik kampung, they're not so educated because they go to Malay government schools. The ones who went to Chinese schools learn better and more."

Yeah, and you know what's shocking?
My parents going about this at every opportunity they get - and are they forgetting that they didn't send their very own children to a "Chinese school" that they put on a so-very-glorious pedestal!?
Let me break this down, you start with some people who did something nuts, lump those of the same race together to "share the fault", then assert dominance that your race is a lot better than the rest.
This is the kind of conversations I hear at the dining table countless times, and on any good day of theirs they'll tell how the Chinese plan ahead unlike the "Malays who only live paycheck to paycheck" or "Malays typically don't do Science so they don't understand anything".
READ MY LIPS, THIS IS BLATANT RACISM FROM THE MINORITY RACE.

From my understanding, racism is usually associated with those who belong to a majority race or demographic against the minorities.
It's bad enough that this is true, but knowing that this isn't the only face of how racism can occur makes my heart boil.
I remember confronting one of my parents about this once, telling them that they shouldn't say such things. "But they are like that one," is all they said.
I HAVE HAD ENOUGH. As much as I love my parents for raising me, I want a life away from their systemic toxicity.. but not to the point of being inconsiderately absent, of course.

**THREE: My family in general.**
This one is more of an introvert's problem than anything else that's justifiable.
As an introvert myself (INFP-T based on my Myers Briggs test, apparently), I tend to cherish alone time.
As much as my parents wished I didn't stay up late like some sort of hobo a lot of the time, I truly cherish the quietness I get not interacting with people at all in the middle of the night when everyone else is asleep.
Sure, I have a part-time job where I have to face students as part of my job.. but in my defense, I take delight knowing that my job consists of me goofing up enough while making sure they learn, and education really is my passion.

Now, I used to think both my parents are extroverts for asking me why I didn't have friends a lot of the time.
Sure, I was often the odd one out amongst the group due to having different interests, a language barrier in some cases, and how I tend to excel in the areas the others seemed to not click with.
I was often bullied a lot, and I owe it to my mom for constantly reminding me to learn to read the room..
I just wished she used that skill every now and then now.
But seriously, their wants for me to have more friends just stemmed a stigma I believed for a long time that they act the way they want me to act..
I remember getting shocked when I found out one of my dad's close friends who goes to the same church as I did told me he didn't view my dad as an extrovert.
It was elusive to me then, but now that I'm at that age where I should be working under normal circumstances, I can finally agree that my dad at least was an introvert.
I still think mom is definitely still a kind of extrovert though - she seems pretty happy being with her friends a lot of the time, and I can't recall the number of times she told me about her early adult years when she'd hang out with her room mates and familiars a lot of the time.

Here's the problem though - I don't like how it seems as if we have to constantly talk to each other to maintain a healthy family relationship.
I'd say my own opinions and thoughts are distinct enough that I've given up hoping all but one of them to share at most a handful of opinions with me.
To me, a healthy family or any healthy relationship is when everyone can instinctively know how to support each other without explicitly obvious communication.
Call it a high standard or an obsession for psychics (I don't have one, they gross me out), but I try to make it that the "reading the room" quality is high up on what I'd expect from any family.
Unfortunately, my time hearing my parents keep wanting me to talk to them at some very inopportune times seeped in as my habits of constantly begging my students to let me know if they have any problems - not that this is a totally bad thing, but at a tertiary education level, one would expect some form of independence in managing their studies.
Ever hear them say "You are to be treated as adults in college/university"?

These habits of theirs make me uncomfortable to speak up. Unlike some lecturers I know, I tend to reflect back whether I'd do the same in their shoes especially with online video calls via Zoom and Teams.
I definitely want a life away from the ones who raised me and grew up with me without a doubt, but only so that I can really recharge as and when I need to.
I used to tell so many people that I wouldn't be left alone even if I was in the bathroom.
Yeah, true. When it's apparently time to talk to them or be together at the dining table, it's like this discrete unsung rule everyone in the house just has to follow.
I DON'T LIKE THAT.
I can definitely see myself having roommates in the future if God's plan is to let me experience sharing rooms again (the first being during my time in MCKL; Khai Yuan if you're reading this, thanks for being the best and only roomie I've had during the short period I was with you!), but for my own sanity and based on my experience with my own family, I'll be very much content wanting to live alone with no family by my side.

As much as I won't look forward to seeing some faces again, I would really love to wish you all the best as soon as SARS-COV-2 becomes endemic.
Everyone's been shaken to a certain extent by the pandemic, up to the core for so many including myself.
I can't bring myself to think of how many people are trying to reach out their hand to help, not knowing that they're not clinging onto something solid that might just give way at any second.
You may be one of those who genuinely wants to help and think that you're ready and willing, but I think I believe nearly NOBODY is ever ready or willing to help.
Till then, get your jabs up, be courteous towards others and most importantly.. find better conversation starter topics!
