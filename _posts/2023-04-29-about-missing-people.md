It has come to my attention that [one of my tweets](https://twitter.com/deezombiedude/status/1648786560115183616){:target="\_blank"} in April 2023 (recent if it's only days away since I last posted) got quite a very, very heavy traction from many Twitter users alike..
Can't imagine why. (Nope, just kidding!)

Who knows, you listening to them may just be what both of you need.<br><br>üé®: <a href="https://twitter.com/Kofeeo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Kofeeo</a> <a href="https://t.co/KHyr27QE2w">pic.twitter.com/KHyr27QE2w</a></p>&mdash; Strix &amp; Peas ü¶â‚ùÑÔ∏è (@deezombiedude) <a href="https://twitter.com/deezombiedude/status/1648786560115183616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 19, 2023</a>
