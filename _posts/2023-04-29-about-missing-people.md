It has come to my attention that [one of my tweets](https://twitter.com/deezombiedude/status/1648786560115183616){:target="\_blank"} in April 2023 (recent if it's only days away since I last posted) got quite a very, very heavy traction from many Twitter users alike..
Can't imagine why. (Nope, just kidding!)

Just for comparison sake, here's what I thought was [my most liked and engaged tweet back in 2021](https://twitter.com/deezombiedude/status/1410452055764836359){:target="\_blank"} when I got my very first commission and doodle sheet from [OrlandoFox](https://afoxdraws.com){:target="\_blank"}:

Side note, I've got all my commissioned art in a cloud storage at the moment.
Still deciding whether or not I'd be putting them all publicly at some place where I can showcase them all, or if `refsheet.net` is a viable alternative. _Also, if you really love what you see in those tweets and wanna like and retweet them some more, go on ahead!_ üòÇ

Not long before I started this post, I had a chat with one of the artists I've commissioned over the years after joining the fandom (she doesn't consider herself as one of them), and there was one thing that she said was true - it's Twitter, some things can just blow up out of nowhere.
It is definitely without a doubt that these things can happen out of nowhere.
Being the dumpster fire it is even before Musk's ownership, it is unpredictable just as is undesirable to some people.
Seriously, I wouldn't bet my money on Twitter being a stable platform to maintain a new online presence anymore.
The main reasons why I use it frequently now are that I've been blessed to find some gems there that keep me sane on the platform, and I did migrate from using Facebook on the daily since late 2021.
They all result from some issues due to reasons including the pandemic season, the Sheraton move in February 2020, and how messed up the country's citizens have become, my Facebook page was nothing short of toxic.. akin to how some ex-Twitter users have unfortunately faced.
I'm just hoping I don't ever reach that point ever again before I find myself elsewhere.

Coming back to that viral tweet I just shared, I commissioned the art with feelings of missing some old friends and my family at the time while I was just wrapping up my first semester in NTU.
Personally, I have someone I regard as my first best friend - he was one I stuck around with ever since we met in Primary 1 at a government school.
Despite me transferring in Primary 3, we still kept in touch.. and I remember the days when we'd talk over the phone (the landline phones you now normally see in offices) for hours, and later on when I'd invite him over to my place and his mom and now late stepdad would fetch him during those planned occurrences till our late teenage years.
The last time I got to meet him was just after I finished my Bachelor's degree, not knowing during then where'd I'd go for graduate studies immediately after.
Little did I know then that I wouldn't be going overseas for studies until about four and a half years later.

I did manage to chat with him a little bit every now and then afterwards, and the one time when we had a heart-to-heart talk on Messenger when I was worried over something personal to me.
Beyond that later on, I have messages that were left not responded to.
Granted, I don't think we had anything we were currently into that we'd be able to talk our time away even if we could now.
All in all, I'm still glad that he's doing alright - we still follow each other on social media. And from the looks of it, he's happy with his time as a dance instructor to some of the most adorable youngins **who'd take your breath away** with how skillful they've become under his tutelage.
He's even got a partner, and I trust that both of them are doing well together.
I can tell you this with a straight face, in person or otherwise, I'm glad he's doing alright.
From what I think I can recall (to that one, if you're seeing this and if what I say is wrong here, please let me know!), he had some turbulent times during his late teen years to his early twenties.
I'll leave it at that, I'm not going to disclose anything that's meant to be personal information here.
