It has come to my attention that [one of my tweets](https://twitter.com/deezombiedude/status/1648786560115183616){:target="\_blank"} in April 2023 (recent if it's only days away since I last posted) got quite a very, very heavy traction from many Twitter users alike..
Can't imagine why. (Nope, just kidding!)

Just for comparison sake, here's what I thought was [my most liked and engaged tweet back in 2021](https://twitter.com/deezombiedude/status/1410452055764836359){:target="\_blank"} when I got my very first commission and doodle sheet from [OrlandoFox](https://afoxdraws.com){:target="\_blank"}:

Side note, I've got all my commissioned art in a cloud storage at the moment.
Still deciding whether or not I'd be putting them all publicly at some place where I can showcase them all, or if `refsheet.net` is a viable alternative. _Also, if you really love what you see in those tweets and wanna like and retweet them some more, go on ahead!_ üòÇ

Not long before I started this post, I had a chat with one of the artists I've commissioned over the years after joining the fandom (she doesn't consider herself as one of them), and there was one thing that she said was true - it's Twitter, some things can just blow up out of nowhere.
It is definitely without a doubt that these things can happen out of nowhere.
Being the dumpster fire it is even before Musk's ownership, it is unpredictable just as is undesirable to some people.
Seriously, I wouldn't bet my money on Twitter being a stable platform to maintain a new online presence anymore.
The main reasons why I use it frequently now are that I've been blessed to find some gems there that keep me sane on the platform, and I did migrate from using Facebook on the daily since late 2021.
They all result from some issues due to reasons including the pandemic season, the Sheraton move in February 2020, and how messed up the country's citizens have become, my Facebook page was nothing short of toxic.. akin to how some ex-Twitter users have unfortunately faced.
I'm just hoping I don't ever reach that point ever again before I find myself elsewhere.

Coming back to that viral tweet I just shared, I commissioned the art with feelings of missing some old friends and my family at the time while I was just wrapping up my first semester in NTU.
Personally, I have someone I regard as my first best friend - he was one I stuck around with ever since we met in Primary 1 at a government school.
Despite me transferring in Primary 3, we still kept in touch.. and I remember the days when we'd talk over the phone (the landline phones you now normally see in offices) for hours, and later on when I'd invite him over to my place and his mom and now late stepdad would fetch him during those planned occurrences till our late teenage years.
The last time I got to meet him was just after I finished my Bachelor's degree, not knowing during then where'd I'd go for graduate studies immediately after.
Little did I know then that I wouldn't be going overseas for studies until about four and a half years later.

I did manage to chat with him a little bit every now and then afterwards, and the one time when we had a heart-to-heart talk on Messenger when I was worried over something personal to me.
Beyond that later on, I have messages that were left not responded to.
Granted, I don't think we had anything we were currently into that we'd be able to talk our time away even if we could now.
All in all, I'm still glad that he's doing alright - we still follow each other on social media. And from the looks of it, he's happy with his time as a dance instructor to some of the most adorable youngins **who'd take your breath away** with how skillful they've become under his tutelage.
He's even got a partner, and I trust that both of them are doing well together.
I can tell you this with a straight face, in person or otherwise, I'm glad he's doing alright.
From what I think I can recall (to that one, if you're seeing this and if what I say is wrong here, please let me know!), he had some turbulent times during his late teen years to his early twenties.
I'll leave it at that, I'm not going to disclose anything that's meant to be personal information here.

I have many, many more close friends who ended up being the same - once seen as nearly unseparable by friendship, now literally miles away from each other, doing our own thing.
For what it's worth, I'm grateful for them and also all of those I've managed to befriend so far in life.
It's sad, really.. I'm at that age where not only I have friends and other connections tying the knot, getting successful, or the like.. but also the time when I know the number of friends I talk to or keep in touch with dwindle just so quickly.
Every friendship is special to me - I was already an awkward kid growing up, and making friends was something that didn't come naturally to me.
Being picked on for how differently I behaved or acted was a norm I lived with, so during the time when we were maturing during our late secondary school years did feel rather weird to say the least.
Speaking of which, most of my secondary school classmates and I did stay together in a WhatsApp group chat together, and never did I think we'd be blessed to have social media on our side to keep us close enough.
Needless to say, unfortunately, as years went by, the class reunion dinner we kept having every Chinese New Year season had its attendance fall gradually.
All of those who didn't turn up were usually busy or just unable to be around to attend; I was one of those people this year when I started studying in Singapore.

Growing up more and more does sometimes make some of us wish to a certain degree that we'd stay young again - be void of worries in a life where we ideally still have all our friends.
For all those who had either the misfortune or a blessing-in-disguise to not experience this, I'm pretty sure you've had this feeling of wanting more friends earlier in life.
In retrospect, I'd guess you have either some choice words to us for wishing such or some life advice you learnt to live and practice since really young.
Those who do face harrowing challenges young in life do tend to have a different outlook than many others, after all.
I'm pretty sure there are also some of these things most of us don't yet understand to as great of a degree as you have.

That reminds me though, we did go through a pandemic very recently too.
That period spelled so much misery to the whole world, and the fact that it cursed so many households either via long-COVID or through the deaths of loved ones who were simply just not lucky was nothing to sneeze over.
I don't know how I should feel for being one of those still counting the days till when I'd eventually be one with the global statistics (you know which one), but seeing how my mom suffered with the virus when she got it last year somehow nearly put me to tears thinking that had she not have been vaccinated against it, there wouldn't be a proper farewell for her.
**NONE of her deathbed wishes would even come true - she has a mental list of it, I can finish listing them down given a few days to remember.**
If any of you readers were one of those who were simply too young to remember or didn't even exist during that time, know that those who were unfortunate to have lost their loved ones to the pandemic couldn't hold any funeral for them, couldn't pay last respects to them, and what I believe is the kicker for many - they couldn't be by their side when their souls depart from this world.
The grief that comes with death is great, but this only amplifies it to possibly the worst extent possible.
Regardless of your stance on vaccines, know that this nightmare is real for too many a person on this planet.
What was that saying - "cherish the people you care before they perish" - is it even doable for them?

I suppose that viral tweet had a caption that resonated too well to gain the attention that it has.. was it a coincidence?
I don't think it's entirely so.
We ought to be grateful for all those who walk into our lives and impact us one way or another for the better.
Your old pals may just be there now when they could've been an active part of your lives.
No matter whether this is true for you, cherish them and if it wasn't obvious - text, nudge, or call them if you can.
Be grateful for the times you were together regardless.. that's an unfortunate spell of life where people may no longer cross paths with each other.
Personally, there are so many friends I'd like to meet again but given my distance from home where it was somewhat nearer to meet them, it's just simply harder.
The ones who have successfully eradicated their online presence - if they're one of them, do all you can to get a hold of them if you really do care.
No matter what, and this is even true for those who choose to break up from a serious relationship - if you truly love them, you sometimes have to let them go.

If you ever need assistance mourning the loss of a beloved one, getting through a divorce or break-up, or even the end of a dear friendship, cry it out.. in silence even, if you need the time.
Talk to people if you have to.
Hug it out, if that makes it any better.
Know very well that there are always people who care for you.
In a world where some people say everything especially beliefs, emotions and feelings are superficial, even those you care who no longer cross paths can find solace knowing if you're well.
You can do the same.
