Things have been tough, I'll eventually muster enough optimism in myself to shield my mind from more negativity I've been constantly fed.
Like I said, it's nothing but episode after episode after episode ever since we were all told to stay home, not like, but DANG WELL BECAUSE our lives depended on it.
Beginning March 18, 2020, that fateful Wednesday, the backdoor-and-now-in-power PN Malaysian government commenced a nationwide lockdown with a stupid acronym that lasted two months.
Um.. not the English acronym (MCO: Movement Control Order), rather the Malay acronym (PKP: Perintah Kawalan Pergerakan).

![Pikapi](/assets/img/Pikachu-Meme.gif){: width="100%"}

> PKP. Pi-ka-pi.

There was a joke I don't find that amusing to hear anymore, that a lockdown like this would be any introvert's dream.
Sure, if all they want to be is a hermit of all kinds of people, but though being quite introverted myself I still find the idea of being a hermit counterintuitive for my own sanity.
I question this thought of mine every other day, because unlike this "heavenly" scenario, I was to be stuck with my immediate family members.
The fact is.. I WAS NOT GOING TO BE ALONE FOR A VERY, VERY LONG TIME.
Forever, possibly, if I was going to be super-mega-ultra pessimistic.
I had just entered my second year of pursuing my Master's degree, all tattered and worn out by all the rush I had to endure during the first year.
I had only finished my proposal defense in January earlier that year, and I was expected to complete the major corrections to my proposal by April.
My state of mind already fell into a deep spiral of non-stop ranting and complaints about so, so many annoyances in life from the beginning of the year. All I see that part of me back then right now is a toxic self.
For many, I believe that staying as a family should be able to form a fort of emotional strength to encourage each other during this time.
However, after spending two weeks only seeing my parents and younger brothers day in and day out, I no longer feel like this belief is ever going to be true for my own family.
My mind snapped and to this day I can't say it has truly recovered at all let alone a bit.

I was already frustrated with my very lackluster progress on my research, already having decided to give up on the April deadline because I was determined not to submit a piece of subpar work again.
The conversations over dinner evening after evening never helped with it.
The one thing I would always hear is my parents go about mentioning "Oh, `insert number` people died today from COVID-19", "Oh no, `insert number` people got infected today", etc.
To say all of this was depressing is a severe understatement.

> "Eh, how many people died today arr?"
>
> \- Like, NO, MAN!!

I'll admit, any paraphrasing of such conversations can be skewed to how I perceive them to be.. but that just proved the point that my mind was already getting screwed left and right.
MCO was initially slated to last for about two weeks, but that number got extended.. multiplied by six.
I don't exactly remember when this happened, but there came a point in the middle of this wretched two-month period where the Malaysian government announced the second phase of MCO.

{% include embed/youtube.html id='B_7-u_Sunmg' %}

Yeah, my mind continued to get screwed over and over.
It was the same come Day 21.
By then it was April 7, 2020.
Our neighbors over at Singapore had to start embracing their own version of lockdown called the Circuit Breaker.
Needless to say, reiterate or postulate, I was in a very bad head space.

If you had asked me what my social media posts were all about during this time, I'd say they were filled with rants, the occasional one or two jokes that were somehow able to cheer me up, and complaints about how the internet at home would just screw me over during when I needed it most.
One thing I have yet to mention was that I also got stressed out over two things - one being a potential employment over at Taylor's College (I was supposed to begin work starting with the March semester of that year), and my Switch Lite's left Joy-con already becoming faulty.
There was no way to get my medical checkup I did back in January certified by the doctor with 10km travel restrictions in place (the clinic was 10.1km away, who knew?) and all non-essential outlets being closed down.
I would find myself passing time refusing to talk to anyone beyond my siblings at the time occasionally and playing Pokémon Sword excessively, trying to fill my repertoire of Pocket Monsters with the 400 I could get during then.
I was neglecting my work to say the least.

Towards the end of the 2-month period, the Malaysian government announced the Controlled MCO (CMCO), or PKPB (PKP Bersyarat).
Try say that one and PKPD (PKP Diperketatkan/Enhanced MCO, EMCO), and see if you can tell the difference by ear.. stupid acronyms.
By then, I had completely shut myself up and showed no interest in joining the pointless conversations over the dining table about the number of deaths around the world and depressing talk.
It really seemed as though the negative posts from Facebook I used to have all this time just got real and transitioned over on the table where I'm supposed to eat in peace!
During the last few days leading to the genesis of the first CMCO, I remember my mom suddenly reprimanding me..

> "Why are you so quiet? Why can't you be more involved in the conversation?"

Inside me, I snapped.
My parents who have already been low-key gossipers have become nothing but spewers of negative talk about the ongoing calamity and racist-like talk against the non-Chinese, and there they were expecting me to feed into such a mindset and conversation.
I was very, very close to venting my frustrations over on the dining table about how they were damaging my already shattered psyche even further.
It was not too long ago when my mom found me watching a video on YouTube about depression and then telling me that it was better if I found something that would reinforce my relationship with everyone in the family.
Mind you, my mom used to be the one who told me to be sensitive and receptive to others' emotions growing up, and learning to say the right things at the right time and place.. she literally flouted that life lesson I hold so dearly today that time.
After those two instances, I made it a point that I'd do all I could to prevent sharing my life's ins and outs with them for as long as I live.
They used to tell me to prioritize my own self to the point of being stingy at times, and combined with this, I decided they were not even worth my time explaining what I do for the most part.. at least unless I'm pretty sure they're fine with it and I was in a jolly mood.
Yes, I eventually did tell my mom this, more or less.

Things were slowly starting to improve as the country entered CMCO and eventually RMCO (Recovery MCO).
The Malay acronym: PKPP (PKP Pemulihan). MAIGOSH, these acronyms are dumb to no end!

I eventually settled my job application and had my Switch Lite fixed.
For the most part things were slowly beginning to brighten up.. as much as it could anyway.
Visitations were already possible within reason, and it seemed like the Health DG (i.e., Tan Sri Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah) was racking praises from the whole nation and parts of the globe.
It was still just no fun having need to worry about our own health when getting out of the house.
Is this what Howie Mandel feels with his OCD and while being a germaphobe? "Don't touch me!"

> Let me just say, knocking elbows is dumb. That being said, I'll be fine not touching you as much as I can for the time being. I don't think I remember how another person's skin feels like anymore at this point.

It was not all smooth sailing though, I still had yet to regain momentum with my proposal corrections, and I had only realized that my toxic self had gotten the better of my own brother who proceeded to block me on one of his platforms a while back.
I felt like I took it well enough when he broke the news to me, and I made peace with retreating to a secondary Facebook account where I had not connected with many of my existing list of Facebook friends.
Still, it haunts me that I may have just doomed myself to be an outcast in his own circle of familiars.
I had already come to terms that being the first-born myself and him being the second, we just don't see nearly all issues the same way.
To think that I may not be able to mend or form a bond with him anymore, I'm just getting myself ready to disappear from his life on the first opportunity I can get (that doesn't involve committing suicide, obviously).
Looking back now, I feel like our thought processes are just too different to be any similar, and I'm fine not being around him anymore.
This emotional dagger will still continue to haunt me for all eternity in the meantime.

I also made it a point that sharing my own frustrations was never worth anyone's time.
People just aren't ready to help anyone like me back then when I had so many issues and annoyances, regardless of how much they say they're willing to hear me out.
I remember being used to trying to be the bright light for others I know who had problems and them to me, but what I didn't realize was that at one point I had reached my limits as to how much I could take in.
I proceeded to wipe my Instagram clean of any complaints involving internet speeds, and posted a message that's still pinned in my (personal) profile to this day:

![I'm Sorry 1](/assets/img/insta-sorry.jpg){: width="100%"}

When a poorly planned election in August at Sabah sprouted a surge in infection cases that led to massive increases in number of cases, it led to my parents suddenly thinking it was a great idea to bring us with them to their holiday home at Port Dickson.
Till that time I was hesitant to even set foot there because I needed my break from them, and I trust that they needed a break from me and my siblings.
I never felt comfortable living with them there, especially since it was nothing more than a small apartment.
Gross conversations and interactions now became unavoidable, and privacy is practically non-existent.
While my dad would occasionally be the one fuming if he had a bad day at work when coming home, I was the one who often had a short fuse while being stuck with them in said holiday home.

I already had that hatred towards the idea of family vacations; back then, whenever we did so by visiting a foreign country, it was nothing more than a rush to see as many places as possible to the point that there was no time to relax - the sites are not going to explode anytime soon, calm the heck down!
During the next two-month span being stuck with them due to inter-state travel restrictions, my hatred evolved into despise, so much so that I believe I would forever refuse to go on a vacation with my parents and/or disconnected brother ever again.
I do plan on visiting Singapore again though, but when that happens, I really want to go ALONE.
I have friends who are living their lives there and recently I've managed to make a new internet friend from that country.
I've only been there less than a handful of times, but I felt like having visited there often enough and during when I was more open to going on vacation made me have a soft spot for the small country.

> I do plan on visiting Singapore again though, but when that happens, I really want to go ALONE.

My hatred and mental craze was off the roof; had I not kept my own faith in the Lord almighty, I would've jumped off that balcony and taken my own life.
I had difficulty keeping my cool when addressing my students at times, especially when one of them was about to just dump the whole semester down the drain after being sick for a month.
I envied said disconnected brother for having the home to himself when he stood firm that he'd be better off staying at home.
Why did I feel I have a reason to place myself in a place of mental stress so willingly? Sure, cases were nearly non-existent.. is what I'd say if it didn't worsen as time passed by.
As soon as December came, when the government decided to let loose the inter-state travel restrictions, I finally managed to have about a week away from the rest of my family.
You may probably be able to tell, when my whole family was reunited back home the week after my heart sunk - there wouldn't be a moment so bliss as what I had experienced for a very, very long time to come.
Cases had already breached the 4-digit mark, and things were already starting to get rough.

The new year soon came - the year everyone else seemed so eager to jump into while chanting something along the lines of "Cancel 2020", "Burn 2020", or "2020 can suck my ass".
I, on the other hand, showed no optimism over the new year.
I had and still have accepted the fact that this year could be just as bad if not worse.
The pandemic has already won my optimism over, it was just hopeless to think all problems will end once 2021 arrived.

I received my first batch of freshies come mid-January for a short semester, and to say some were being a handful was just the tip of the iceberg.
I wouldn't fault them for the most part, this was a new start for them.. but I felt I had enough stress on my hands.
I eventually did finish my proposal corrections a year after being tasked to do so in two months (oops), and because some of them were pretty proactive during class, I felt like my spirits were somewhat being lifted.
CNY 2021 was lackluster to say the least - I only got myself a sweater with a color as yellow as April O'Neill's jumpsuit to "celebrate" the occasion.
The thought of begging others for angpow money via e-wallet transfers did fume me a little; I remember being reprimanded when I was half my current age for just asking my aunt for angpow so casually like I was collecting tax from them.

Today, I would say I'm still broken mentally as ever.
Now that I'm at the point of developing my solution, I struggle again to make myself pick up any motivation to start.
My lecturing workload basically doubled, and as I'm writing this while on the first week of the semester, I haven't completed the third set of lecture slides for one of my classes and the fourth for another, let alone the practical work be prepared for one of those subjects.
There's also making that tax account, for absolutely no reason since my salary isn't large enough to be taxed at present moment.
Worst of all is the still all-so-very negative talk over on the dining table.

The past 12 months or so have been cruel to me, just as it has probably been even more for many others.
I acknowledge that what I'm going through isn't the ultimate worst case scenario, and my hopes and prayers are out there for those who have it worse than me and the rest of the world population.
While my mental state has been in quite a limbo around a depressive state, I can safely say that I've achieved some things throughout this time period.
For one, I've managed to drop 16 kilos of my own body weight by regulating my meal portions and the number of times I feast a day.
Right now, I'm basically living off only having lunch and dinner every day and only having breakfast when I know I have to be up early and have a long day ahead of me.
I had a habit of stress-eating that started during my second year in undergrad, and to see that all the weight I gained from that bad habit be let loose from myself literally was refreshing.
Pretty sure I'm not anorexic, but I plan on keeping this up for as long as I can.
Also, recently I've begun a somewhat unique interest after researching the topic up, and I've made some great friends during that discovery period.
I've now transitioned my social media habits more on Twitter and Instagram, making sure I prune my feed of any negativity and see more positive stuff online.. like cat videos for instance!

This year is still far from being better than what was the year 2020, though.
There are a few wishes I have for the year while 2021 still has not yet ended:

1.  Vaccination (or for those of you who are skeptics of vaccines, the end of the pandemic in general)

    Raise your hand if you're already sick of all the mess this pandemic or situation has stirred all around the world.
    You there, yes, you.
    I'm quite eager to get myself vaccinated as soon as possible to help produce a herd immunity amongst the community surrounding me, hopefully ending the spread of the COVID-19 virus before it gets a whole lot worse.
    For all those not going to get the vaccine due to reasons I'd rather not know, all I ask is to respect others before yourselves.
    The line between self-care and selfishness is a line all of us need to be aware of if we want to be decent human beings; that being said, I do not plan on condemning you for your respective responses towards the vaccination program.

2.  More positive talk amongst the community, especially within my own family

    Being part of one of the minority races here in Malaysia, we often give flak to politicians (most Malay politicians) who go about messing around and practicing a double-standard, lavish lifestyle while we are busy worrying over our own health, safety and life assurances.
    That being said, if we ever want to criticize them, don't just lump everyone of the same race together and say all of them are useless - you may not mean it, but that's not what I'm hearing.
    Rather than dwell on gossiping about other races, engage in more constructive conversations or if you have anything nice to say, prioritize getting that out of the way first.
    Learn to read the room, atmosphere, or the person you're trying to interact with.
    If you don't have anything pleasant to say, don't mention it just because, unless there is a valid purpose of doing so.

    To the family members reading this, I'm sorry if any of what I say here has offended you, and I mean this just as much as how much I get frustrated with your habits that's not doing any good.
    I know the government will never ever be perfect, and the current situation isn't any better with a lot of the dinkleberries up in cabinet along with the criminals of races outside of our own.
    However, this is not a valid excuse to dismiss everyone of the other races as "always being like that".
    What makes you think we Chinese are any better, if what we talk is from thoughts that are not thought through well enough?
    Racism is real; just as the west have race issues between the Whites and other minority races like the Black people, Asians, aborigines, etc., we here have a racist system between the Malays, us Chinese, Indians, and all the other minority races as well.
    Such unnecessary flak on them will do no good in striving for a more peaceful Malaysia.
    I know there are talks of saying that there are greener pastures outside from this country, but while we're here, this is what we have.
    Please practice what you actually teach us since young, we can't stay this way forever.
    We need more light on those who are actually doing their jobs right.
    Publicizing these people is way better than shining the limelight on the unworthy ones.
    What you all are talking over on the table isn't healthy, please stop it.
    And please don't invite me on any of your planned family vacations unless it's not a super duper manic-filled one focused on visiting sites like we're the plague.

3.  Responsible higher-ups

    I don't think I'm qualified to even say this, seeing that I've already breached the minimum period of completing my Masters degree through contemplation and various depressive episodes.
    I'm also one who tends to stray away from topics relating to politics, seeing that I'm surrounded by connections who would simply not shut their yap up about their "superior" judgment over everything around them.
    That being said, I believe those in power need to make sure that they practice the highest integrity levels imaginable.
    As a prefect back in secondary school, I was taught that as the ones helping to reinforce school rules amongst the other students, we are not allowed to practice double standards and expect any exemptions over issues.
    In fact, our punishments are supposed to be double compared to the other students as elected reinforcers the teachers are willing to place their trust on.
    The same should be said for all of you managing our country.
    I have doubts that you'd regain the trust from most of us after what has already been done, but the very least you all should do is to keep us safe in your hands.
    Like it or not, we only have you to depend on during this very difficult and strenuous period.
    I don't mean to sound like a broken record, but we are sick of all the antics and annoyances you make.
    Stop giving us the reason to condemn you more than what you've already committed in the past after suddenly sweeping in as the backdoor government we never voted for in the first place.
    I'll end this part by thanking those who are actually being proactive during their jobs. No names, unfortunately.
    My gratitude will always be shown through actions rather than potentially meaningless words on social media.
    Those are just my two cents on the matter, end of line.

4.  A more grateful outlook from everyone

    We all wish we can have this elusive reset button that'd wipe off COVID-19, bring back the ones we've lost, and grant us chances to reconnect with loved ones potentially and do over.
    Unfortunately, that's not the world we're living in today.
    Still, I urge everyone to learn to be grateful for what you have.
    Even for those who are considered poor, I personally envy you all sometimes when I think back to how much harder it'd be for me to let go of all my possessions compared to you.
    I believe you all are much braver than most of us combined. While you all strive to make ends meet, remember to be grateful.
    For the rest of us who are more able, we should also be more grateful.
    After refraining myself from over-complaining about petty stuff like internet being down too much, I have one less negative thought to deal with.
    We have possessions and gifts; we should use all we can in order to help those in need, or otherwise find delight in being hardworking individuals contributing to the betterment of our society.
    Life is more than just what we make it to be at times.
    What were the good values we vowed to practice again? - that's a question you'll need to ask yourself every day.
    I can ramble on with this, but if you still can't get this through your thick skulls, just go hug a tree or something.

5.  A stronger me

    It's safe to say I'm still in the process of recovering and searching for my missing optimism.
    Still, I am grateful for every single little happy thing that came marching my way since the start of the year.
    Having no optimism during the start of the year, the impact I felt was rejuvenating.
    I'll mention what new interest I've found recently in a later post when I feel like I can publicize it, but for now I'm keeping it hush-hush. 😉
    All I hope and pray for myself is that I can keep myself focused on my work, and regain that flare I had when I first joined Sunway as a Master's degree student.
    That, or I find my true passion I can indulge into some day. God bless us all.

It's around the second half of April during the time of this post, nearly a third of the year has gone by.
May we all get through the year stronger and as much better people than in the last year.
To end this rather long post off with a good note, here's my favorite social media post I found last year:
