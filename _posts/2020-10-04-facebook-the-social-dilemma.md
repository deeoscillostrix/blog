I'll be straight - I have not watched "The Social Dilemma" on Netflix, because I don't own a Netflix subscription.
My current interests do not require me to own one despite many who have resorted to binge watching their favorite shows and movies while the world is busy combatting a pandemic that has killed millions (and in turn, giving opportunities for nincompoops to create nuisances to those of us who are doing our part to get through this living nightmare).
Still, I apparently have friends and connections (some of whom are literally in close proximity) who self-indulge with anything polarizing on the internet and social media, and it made me sick to the core that for the first eight months of the year I've been spewing nothing but negativity in my social media accounts.
I regret these actions and I have already begun taking measures to weed out the unnecessary and sometimes outlandish pessimism in my news feeds.

Still, I can't help but reflect for a bit as soon as I stumbled on Casey Newton's tweet while I was casually scrolling through Twitter. No, I don't follow him just yet, but it was there since Nilay Patel (the one I'm following) liked it - and in turn it showed up in my news feed.. nice.
~~The tweet I saw in my news feed is as shown here:~~

_(Edit: Hi, **future Oscii** here. 👋🏻
It seems like the tweet's been gone since I last posted this on my previous blog.
I'll drop the excerpt as to what it says here below.
If I can recover that tweet for any reason at all, I'll update it here later.)_

Facebook has published its review of The Social Dilemma and it did NOT like it.

I'm still digesting all this in as much as I can, and I'll just put out a disclaimer that I'm merely just stating my own opinions from the articles I see. I don't think anyone should just agree or disagree, but these are just my opinions based from my experiences with social media as a whole. Remember, I have not yet watched the movie/documentary/film (I'm just gonna call it film from here) at the time I'm creating this post, so I'm pretty sure I'm not going to be addressing anything from the movie intentionally. Now that's out of the way, let's go back to the issue at hand.

From here, it seems Facebook is showing disagreement with the film - and Facebook has seven key points to back it up. After reading through what Facebook has to say, I'm going to assume that there may have been some over-dramatization of what's been shown in the film and I would agree if that were the case. Still, by looking through the reasons I just can't help but give my two-cents on what areas of improvement that have been overlooked or aren't really visible from their perspective.. or it's gonna just be rubbish being spewed from my mouth. If you want to see what Facebook has had to say, here it is: [What The Social Dilemma Gets Wrong](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/What-The-Social-Dilemma-Gets-Wrong.pdf){:target="\_blank"}

## SUMMARY FOR TL;DR

Now this is a long post, probably my longest to date, so if you want a summary of my incoherent thoughts here, here it is:

1. Facebook shouldn't act like our self-proclaimed righteous parent to regulate what we see on our feed. Their assumptions don't speak for our actual interests.
2. Handling our personal information is a BIG DEAL.. it should not be taken lightly, and people should know this better.
3. Facebook's algorithm shouldn't be 'mad', but because they aren't perfect they should really get their act straight and not play God here.
4. We don't know exactly what goes on in Facebook, but while we are allowed to make opinions, don't judge too quickly.
   Also, we should really start taking extra precautions ourselves and stop prioritizing convenience over safety whenever possible.
5. People, get your crap together and start being mindful of your actions on social media.
   Also, again.. Facebook, don't play God here.
6. I don't know enough, I'm not an American. I'll just hope for the best.
7. There's no guarantee that misinformation will never happen while we're alive, but we should all do our part in preventing the spread of misinformation genuinely.

## My Reasons Why Facebook is Wrong

Anyway, here's my take on the seven key points Facebook has to say about what "The Social Dilemma" got wrong:

### REASON 1: Addiction - Facebook builds its products to create value, not to be addictive.

> ..in 2018 we changed our ranking for News Feed to prioritize meaningful social interactions and deprioritize things like viral videos. The change led to a decrease of 50M hours a day worth of time spent on Facebook. That isn't the kind of thing you do if you are simply trying to drive people to use your services more.

Now, one issue I would like to address is how social media giants and other tech corporations wrongly get this idea that it is their own utmost responsibility to regulate how things are being suggested to us.
Right here, it seems as though Facebook feels it's their responsibility to make sure we indulge with more meaningful social interactions than viral videos.
Imagine for a moment, if you were a child of a parent who is quick to invalidate others' opinions or advice on how to parent you - that's exactly what I'm thinking when I read this portion of the article.
For a lot of us, social media used to be the escape from reality where we can alleviate our problems from our daily lives.
Now it has simply become that stupid space filled with a lot of negative attention and real life somehow doesn't feel or sound so bad.

Sure, addiction to social media is never good for the younger generation and those around my age group, but this is one of those times where the pleasure of being able to watch cats get scared of cucumbers is a whole lot better than listening to your "friend" repeatedly bash a local politician for some things he/she did wrong and not consider the merits of his/her other actions.
This reason alone is good enough for some of my close friends to deactivate their social media accounts and "disappear from the face of the earth.. forever".
There's a certain part of this argument I have not yet mentioned just yet, but that'll come soon after the next point.

### REASON 2: YOU ARE NOT THE PRODUCT - Facebook is funded by advertising so that it remains free for people

> But even when businesses purchase ads on Facebook, they don't know who you are. We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people who are seeing their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that personally identifies you unless you give us permission. We don't sell your information to anyone. You can always see the 'interests' assigned to you in your ad preferences, and if you want, remove them.

I won't talk about my stance on users using free stuff as being products, I promise. You've probably heard enough people talking about it.

Alright, sure.
This is not new - when has the disclaimer stating no private information is to be given voluntarily to businesses be considered new?
In fact, it's pretty much a staple requirement at this point.
That being said, for a lot of us, we are pretty much desensitized with this disclaimer in two ways - you're either overly critical and do not believe anything they say touching this issue, or you don't really care so long as nothing they do that's convenient is affected.
I personally belong to the first camp, but I think I'm a little more optimistic than your otherwise typical skeptic.
I think nearly if not all the problems stemming from this issue ties in with some simple bad luck - Murphy's Law.
If you can, assume for a moment that anyone who says this disclaimer truly means it.
This still will not prevent the chance of being unintentionally exploited by having all the private information they try to cling onto so dearly be exposed to the cruel and unforgiving world.
As soon as this happens, BEWM!
XXX is now just as bad as a typical cyber criminal, everyone hates XXX, everyone should cancel or stop using XXX, yada yada yada, "Oh, how the tables have turned.."
You get the picture.

Now if such an event never happens in such instances, there's still one more problem to tackle - satisfying users' convenience tolerances.
Even if any social media giant were to take steps and precautions to prevent such bad things from happening, they are still steps - steps that can translate into more steps users have to take in order to comply with the efforts being put here.
For those of you in third-world countries or those where technology isn't as advanced as what you find in places like the US, Canada, UK, Japan, etc., you may know what I mean.
There are efforts to educate the older generation and the tech illiterates about the dangers of not keeping their guard up online, but from what I see being based in Malaysia, these efforts mostly deal with making sure kids don't stay addicted to digital devices or see anything inappropriate.
I'm not saying they're wrong, but this is one issue where just as much education is needed.
It's not enough that your 6-year-old shouldn't be obsessed with Raphael stabbing Foot soldiers with his sai, adults alike should also learn that convenience is a double-edged sword and sometimes, it's not worth having that convenience around in place of online safety.
The sad thing is, you can't use nerds to explain this issue to them - you need those who are able to talk about all this in plain, layman terms. What's worse is that some of those being reached out can easily disregard or forget what they've learnt in that one or two hours sitting and listening to someone else scream his/her heart out.
"Masuk telinga kanan, keluar telinga kiri", as they say here. (Translation: "enter through the right ear, exit from the left ear")

Side note, I'm still very, very unimpressed that the MySejahtera app used here to check into places still requires all permissions (some of which I think is completely unnecessary) to be granted for use - and that's a bigger issue judging from how you can still find some users still using devices with Android 4.4 Kitkat or earlier where all these permissions have to be granted in one go before being installed instead of having them alert you for each permission starting Android 5.0 Lollipop.
Until this is rectified, I'm perfectly content with booting up my web browser every time to key in my particulars manually.

_(Edit: Hi, **future Oscii** here again. 👋🏻
While I still do opine on how stupid it was to require a lot of permissions then, MySejahtera has eventually included a ton of features that warranted a real need to have it in our mobile devices.
Gotta hand it to Khairy Jamaluddin, he's been the MVP during a good duration of the pandemic.)_

In the end, THIS ISSUE IS JUST A VERY TERRIBLY MASSIVE, BIG DEAL, and one should learn to understand that keeping a promise as big as this one is never easy.
Anything of value is always sought after, be it legally or illegally.. and sometimes you simply can't justify its value to some not-always-ignorant people.
All I can say here to all the corporate giants taking this risky chance is to not underestimate those businesses you're collaborating with.
This is one area I think the likes of Facebook and other social media giants should look into whilst the relatively smaller initiatives tackle the everyday social media awareness programs for children and adults; if any of you are already doing this, I tip my hat off to you, keep doing what it is you're doing.

### REASON 3: ALGORITHMS - Facebook's algorithm is not 'mad.' It keeps the platform relevant and useful

> Algorithms and machine learning improve our services. For example, at Facebook, we use them to show content that's more relevant to what people are interested in, whether it's posts from friends or ads. Portraying algorithms as 'mad' may make good fodder for conspiracy documentaries, but the reality is a lot less entertaining.

Alright, let's get back to what I didn't address for Reason 1.
Algorithms are like blueprints stating steps to be taken. Anything that can be modeled as using a procedure can have an algorithm.
The problem here is that algorithms used here and in machine learning are man-made.
"To err is human."
Sounds familiar?
How about thinking back on how art is easy to learn but difficult to master?
Algorithms may comprise of logic and math combined together into code, but developing or making algorithms combines that and the art of comprehension - no algorithm is considered good if its purpose simply does not meet the users' requirements - that's why we have system analysts!
Still, they are human, and in that sense, not that different from you and me.
Now, even if social media uses algorithms to the best of their ability to show relevant posts to us, that's up to human interpretation and that's what's being hard-coded into these machine learning algorithms!

Also, one thing you should know is machine learning isn't named "machine learning" just for namesake.
According to T. Mitchell (1997), machine learning is formally defined as when "a computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks T, as measured by P, improves with experience E".
Basically, it's spelling out the fact that machines carry out a learning action that can be measured with an understandable metric.
In a way, the machine is simulating learning actions similar to how humans learn as much as possible.
When we learn, we should expect to make mistakes because we are in the process of perfecting ourselves.
Unfortunately, like many unlucky people, the world presents no room for mistakes.. and this issue is no exception.
From experience I lost count how many times I've been advertisements for something I have no interest in, like certain game genres I'm not currently into.

What's worse is that some ads are straight up garbage, trying to get people into games through illegitimate and misleading advertisements (looking at you, Playrix), to trying to entice people with playing choice with "beautiful ladies", hoping they'd strike gold with _hentais_ across the globe.
Not only are the machine learning algorithms flawed in various capacities, there are still stupid advertisements everywhere that should not have gone past the eyes of the tech giants out there!
This expands to those like YouTube, where some content creators get their videos flagged for "inappropriate language" when there's not a single one found, while leaving those with channels promoting what goes against the supposedly "strict guidelines" unscathed.
It still horrifies me that there are those like in the EU who wish to have these tech giants do the regulating themselves than trust the public with their own stuff - they can't even place a ban hammer or strike on the right people properly!
In their defense, this is not an easy job to do.
However, that should also mean they should be as transparent with their processes taken as much as possible, and admit their own faults instead of being shamed after countless denials.
Regardless of if you believe in God or not, in my eyes, no one should be playing God over anyone here.
We aren't perfect, stop acting like we are.
I genuinely want to stand behind Facebook on the stance that their algorithm is not 'mad', but their undoings and the same for a lot of other tech giants are seriously not helping them out in this dumpster fire of a situation.

### REASON 4: DATA - Facebook has made improvements across the company to protect people's privacy

> Despite what the film suggests, we have policies that prohibit businesses from sending us sensitive data about people, including users' health information or social security numbers, through business tools like the Facebook Pixel and SDK. We do not want this data and we take steps to prevent potentially sensitive data sent by businesses from being used in our systems.

Okay, sure.
With the whole terrible scandal with the US elections back in 2016 leading to their countless bad days in 2018 with Cambridge Analytica (which in turn has shut down completely soon after, yikes), it's only natural that many people stopped trusting Facebook.
Heck, to a great extent, I have too.
No matter what they say, it's already obvious they lost a lot of happy people that year.
Chances are, you might be signing up for accounts for other services not through Facebook, or if those of you who are more tech savvy had in the past done so unlinked their accounts from Facebook.

But in all honesty, problems like this don't only relate to Facebook.
If you're one who's used your e-mail for countless subscriptions, there's a website by Australian web security expert Troy Hunt where you can find out whether your e-mail account has been compromised: [Have I Been Pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com/){:target="\_blank"}

Then again, I'm not security expert.
I'm not even sure if the whole thing is legitimate, but I don't see a good reason why.
The website correctly listed all of the recent scandal involvements with the ones I subscribed to with my primary e-mail address.

My point is that if you want to hold Facebook accountable for their scandal, you should hold all the others with the same accountability too.
You can hate on Facebook all you want, and say they only mess up while Google can easily track your search history.
You can say Facebook can sell pictures of you to businesses, and still use YouTube to make some act go viral.
I'm just saying everyone should maintain their level of accountability and skepticism equal across all services you use.
It's not just Facebook, you shouldn't go around telling children not to share their contact number with others while you blindly trust the apps you download on your device without checking if the permissions required are actually necessary.
Still, do what you must. I won't judge you there, but at least have this in your conscience.

Facebook definitely has done some good here; I remember my parents and I not being able to remove our phone numbers after keying in them once for our Facebook accounts at least two years back, but recently I've been able to remove it completely from my account (while hoping my number hasn't been stored in some backup they have).
Go Facebook. 👍🏻

### REASON 5: POLARIZATION - We take steps to reduce content that could drive polarization

> The truth is that polarization and populism have existed long before Facebook and other online platforms were created and we consciously take steps within the product to manage and minimize the spread of this kind of content. The overwhelming majority of content that people see on Facebook is not polarizing or even political—it's everyday content from people's friends and family.

This - YES.. YES!!

![Yes... YES...](/assets/img/zim_yes.gif){: width="100%"}

Oh my goodness, this is so true.
This is so relatable in so many ways, and in some of them it really shows it's my fault for having them added into my friends list.
I am pretty sure a lot of you who read this will understand where I am going with this.
Yeah, you may be partly to blame for all the negative insanity going on in social media.
With the advent of COVID-19 messing our lives and turning everything upside-down, it is so easy for some of us to resort to using social media as our very own punching bag.
The problem is, there are way people who read this stuff and for some of them, it will negatively affect the rest of their day.
I'm not entirely interested in anything that requires me to argue over anything, and it bothers me a lot if I have to be dragged into a situation where I have to fight or retaliate unwillingly.
I can easily write my whole story on how I coped throughout the first two months of LOCKDOWN, but that'd stray away from the topic so I'll leave it for another time.

As social media users, we still have a responsibility to be decent human beings - many times we forget that just because we don't see each other physically behind a black rectangular screen, it doesn't mean we can be a jerk without consequences.
Every action has a reaction, Newton's Third Law.
Yeah, we are supposed to be free to post whatever we want, just like in life.
However, that is not a valid excuse to be indecent in society - people already get jailed for doing this in real life, and I think it is about time we all act like this will happen to us online if we cross the line. Like I said earlier, we aren't perfect, stop acting like you are. Don't play God.

That being said, Facebook isn't in the clear either.
While what they say about the source of polarizing content isn't their doing, it's not to say they aren't responsible for it either.

While some posts from more polarizing news sources get a lot of interactions, likes or comments, this content is a tiny percentage of what most people see on Facebook.
News from these kinds of Pages doesn’t represent the most viewed news stories on Facebook either.

> We reduce the amount of content that could drive polarization on our platform, including links to clickbait headlines or misinformation. We conduct our own research—and directly fund that of independent academics—to better understand how our products might contribute to polarization so that we can continue to manage this responsibly.
>
> This first paragraph here is simply not true for some, and I would know.. because I'm one of those not living their statement here. I lost count how many pages have been suggested to me showing all the negative press in the world, let alone my country from the perspective of very-impossible-to-please people. I remember sitting down for an hour or two weeding out all the sources of negativity from my news feed, but in about three months I am again fed with suggestions to watch depressing content. At one point I envied my mother for being able to watch videos of cute animals doing silly things everyday.. that's how bad it's been.

This definitely ties in with the algorithms they use all over again..
Facebook, if you want to say you plan on reducing the amount of polarizing content on your platform, walk the talk.
Make sure all of us are seeing this done right.

### REASON 6: ELECTIONS - Facebook has made investments to protect the integrity of elections

> We've acknowledged that we made mistakes in 2016. Yet the film leaves out what we have done since 2016 to build strong defenses to stop people from using Facebook to interfere in elections. We've improved our security and now have some of the most sophisticated teams and systems in the world to prevent attacks. We've removed more than 100 networks worldwide engaging in coordinated inauthentic behavior over the past couple of years, including ahead of other major global elections since 2016.

I'm not an American, and I have not set foot on the land of the free just yet - so I'll refrain from making opinions here..
I don't think I know or seen enough to justify myself or do any of that.
But if what they do is true, fine by me.
I just hope they don't do this same thing across other countries, especially my country where I'm living right now.. fingers crossed.

### REASON 7: MISINFORMATION - We fight fake news, misinformation, and harmful content using a global network of fact-checking partners

> We know our systems aren't perfect and there are things that we miss. But we are not idly standing by and allowing misinformation or hate speech to spread on Facebook.

The rest of what Facebook says for this key point is irrelevant - Facebook WILL allow misinformation to fester on their platform, just not willingly (or so they have some of us think such).
There isn't such a thing as a perfect system that's not complex, and Facebook is already complex through how it evolved from its early days beyond a decade ago till now.
Algorithms can fail due to it being man-made, and people will fail due to our own free will and opinions - our own imperfections per se.
If a glimmer of hope can make you smile a little for just a moment while looking through this issue, let me just say it's better than straight up saying that they won't do anything about it.. just saying.

We all should do our part too - whether Facebook or any of the other tech giants listen or not, we should do what we must.
If you're one of those people who's into the notion of not waiting for others to start an initiative, this is your moment to truly do what your heart tells you to do.
But let's be honest while we do our part too, be the good hypocrite for Pete sake.

## CONCLUSION

Well, if you've read this far, I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
I don't classify myself as a blogger, but I haven't had any reason to use this platform till now apart from experimentation.
Once I figure out how to add comments onto my blog, I hope you'll take your time to share your opinions with me.
Again, this is all my own opinions and I am only talking from my own perspective, so it's definitely possible that I'd miss out from your perspectives here.
I'll continue to read through other articles online on this topic while I can during this busy period.. studying and teaching at the same time is no easy feat!
Remember, let's continue to be decent while we're online, and I'm hopeful we will get through the messy situation in the world together.

Till the next post, stay strong, stay safe, and stay sane!
