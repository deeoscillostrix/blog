# First Post

Hey there!
Happy to see you swing by my brand spanking-new blog!

Before I go on with introductions, I have to say that starting a new blog as a hoot really makes it feel like I've ascended up to Geronimo Stilton's level in some sense.
Not that I'd be publishing books or making blog posts the same way as how much he manages to chug out children's books, but still.. I can't really say the same for the last few times I started a blog and then would just stop them completely.
