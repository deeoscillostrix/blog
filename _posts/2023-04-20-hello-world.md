Hey there! I'm **Oscillo Strix**, but feel free to call me _Oscii_ for short.
I sometimes go under the alias `deezombiedude` on some of my socials.
Happy to see you swing by my brand spanking-new blog!

Before I go on with introductions, I have to say that starting a new blog as a hoot really makes it feel like I've ascended up to Geronimo Stilton's level in some sense.
Not that I'd be publishing books or making blog posts the same way as how much he manages to chug out children's books, but still.. I can't really say the same for the last few times I started a blog and then would just stop them completely.
Previously, I branded my blog as _"Incoherent Thoughts"_, named after the fact that I can get scatterbrained easily, distracted and also be unable to hold a conversation without having proper flow of speech and stutter.
I debated on doing the same for this blog; however, I think now that I'm going full on with this blog not as my in-real-life self but as my furry sona instead, I want to see if I can land a more meaningful name before resorting to calling this blog the same one.
But really though, as many times as I told myself to not need a purposefully created blog to let loose my thoughts and feelings when I should instead be conversing with a therapist, I think that keeping some of it quiet won't do me any kind of justice.
Hence, I think it's only best that I keep the blog this time, and really leave it be in the worst case where I don't see myself wanting to put up any posts anymore.

Now about myself.. during the time of typing out this post, I lectured for around 2.5 years at [Taylor's College](https://college.taylors.edu.my){:target="\_blank"} under the School of Pre-University Studies, tending to students from the Foundation (in Computing, Engineering) and Diploma in Information Technology programs.
As far as study qualifications go, I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Taylor's University](https://university.taylors.edu.my){:target="\_blank"}, and I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Cybersecurity at [Nanyang Technological University](https://ntu.edu.sg){:target="\_blank"}.
As such, this means I currently reside in Singapore, but this hoot originally hails from Malaysia - my home country that I love, but ultimately have very conflicting, mixed feelings for - that's good for another post I can put up.

Personally, I have a strong passion for teaching and education; academically I have a knack of things that relates to math and computing in general.
Having been one who'd be quick with IT literacy and math concepts, naturally this was where I guess I would find myself from a professional standpoint.
Teaching as a passion came from a life of being a hard-to-handle child back in my younger days; that is enough to warrant another post by itself.
I also have a bunch of haphazard interests; currently I am into casual games, making silly little websites, family-friendly comedy routines (the ones mostly on talent shows, don't judge) among other things, and uh.. openly being a nutter for anthro animals.
Yep, you heard me first.
I can say that I'm an online weirdo, just not the indecent kind.
I may get to talking more about how I stumbled onto the fandom in a future post going forward.

I have quite a lot to talk about, now that I've gone through some things, composed myself after roughly 2-3 years of pandemic life no thanks to the you-know-what virus, that kind of stuff.
It'd defeat the purpose of having a blog like this if I do decide to spill everything about me in this introduction, and I would very much prefer that you fellow readers gradually opiniate on how I am with each and every post I dish out.
I also have export saves of my previous blog hosted with Ghost before I took it down, but judging from how convoluted the JSON files containing my previous posts were.. it'd be a colossal task to extract the few posts I made during that time.
It'd be conspicuously sus to have blog posts that are even older than this introduction post.
I may be able to work around it if I do feel that the message conveyed in those older posts would still make relevance in this day and age.
Otherwise, if there's a way to remake those posts under new eyes in a different mind from how I was a few years back, I'll remake them here.

If you would like to see an alternate and admittedly unhinged intro, go check out [my main GitHub IO page](https://deeoscillostrix.github.io){:target="\_blank"}, where I also have links to my other socials as well as other twiddydinkies some of you may be interested in.
~~As soon as I get a hold of _a certain furry costume that set me back my last 4-5 months of salary from Taylor's_, I also intend on opening up a second YouTube channel for video-styled journal entries or advice sessions.~~
I've said it once in the [About page](https://deeoscillostrix.github.io/blog/about){:target="\_blank"}, and I'll say it here again - if you just so happen to know me in real life, please do not address me as my real self here just yet.
Part of the reason why I'm restarting a blog is to be able to hopefully have some fun here without too many prying eyes who may be nosy with what I do, and to give new life to something I would otherwise deem as extremely choresome.
I also don't really like being in the limelight and I can get afraid of so many people who just don't happen to be my pool of students, so yeah.. this birb gets frightened easily!

A huge thanks to [TechnoTim](https://youtube.com/@technotim){:target="\_blank"} for his walkthrough on how he used this same Jekyll static-site generator, as well as [Cotes Chung and the other folks who created and contributed to developing Chirpy](https://chirpy.cotes.page){:target="\_blank"} for finally answering my doubts as to whether or not there's a way to make a blog I'm happy with to be hosted on GitHub!
Not going to lie, what you've provided was all the motivation I absolutely needed to eventually get myself a blog working again!

I look forward to having a blast sharing on this platform!
I know I just made a few loose promises of posts explaining certain things about me on this blog, but do sound off in the comments (if I have it working) if you want to hear more!
Feel free to introduce yourselves in there as well if you'd like me to connect with you more.

Till then, always take care and this hoot wishes all of you well! ðŸ¦‰
