It's a long time coming, and now that I've got some ideas brewing in my head on what to blog on, so hopefully this'll keep a momentum going no matter how short it may be!
In lieu of trying to actually keep my sleep cycle in check, my blog posts may be created over a span of a few days rather than trying to get the whole thing done in one sitting from start to finish.
I do have a tendency of starting these things late.. as appropriate for a hoot such as myself lmao 🤣

I just published another iteration of my personal website (on a separate domain, not the one I'm hosting on GitHub IO); albeit not much has changed, a lot of the modifications were under the hood and also cleaning up how the site actually looks.
Now that it's been published, I've had some doubts over what social links I've relinquished there.
Mind you, said website is meant to be semi-professional while light-heartedly showcasing myself as how one would meet me in real life.
In recent events and also how I've been using my socials (mostly Twitter), I have some second doubts on whether or not this side of my life should be put on display there in any shape or form.

You can say that I've been (and still am) a strong proponent for being true to yourself rather than needing to please some people who would really just wind up not liking you anyway.
Call it an after effect of being picked on a lot during my early school days, but it does me a lot better to not have to be a worrywart over one more thing in my life.
Looking back, it felt like a lot of the worry I had about fitting in as an impressionable hatchling and during my early teen years dissipated as I got older.
In contrast, my parents who meant well with advising me how to go about presenting myself in my daily life became the ones who would worry that I'd be shunned all because I was fine wearing a simple 5-year-old (or older) tee that wasn't tattered in the mall if there wasn't any special occasion going on.
Key word here, is "dissipate"; I admittedly still struggle with overthinking about whether what I'd do would offend others that matter unknowingly at first misopportunity.

However you may relate to what I say here, dear reader, can ring true to whichever social media platform you know and possibly have a history with.
Personally for me, I've mostly a gripe with being on Facebook, but lately I've gained an opinion with online presence on LinkedIn and Twitter.. and these are the ones I'll be talking more about right here in this post.

## My Thoughts on LinkedIn

Back to about fitting in, I feel like there are people who do still believe in judging a book by its cover, despite that one famous saying that echoed a bit during our English classes warning us not to do so as good etiquette.
This rings true not only in real life, but it reeks of it (stronger in my opinion) on social media especially LinkedIn.
I'm not sure about you, but I've pretty much given up on keeping my LinkedIn active beyond being an alternative online resume for myself, and just so that I have at least some sense of professional online presence standing.

I stumbled on a video about LinkedIn not too long ago, and I encourage you to give it a watch.
This really spoke to my soul as I watched this while commuting from church that one day.

The biggest feeling I get when I open up my feed on LinkedIn is a sense of inadequacy after looking at everyone else rushing to publish their achievements like there's no tomorrow.
As someone who already struggles with impostor syndome, this unwanted feeling only compounded on dulling some of my days that would've been sweet otherwise.
This _kiasu_-ness can be beneficial if practiced in moderation, and honestly it was something I wanted my ex-students to feel so that they can mentally prep themselves for what they ask for in the computing and IT field.
However, it really just does seem as if there's nothing more rewarding than one-upping your peers by putting up something so prestigious, even if it's more for clout than personal achievement.
The sense of gratification after achieving something meaningful in life seemed to just become less sought after as time passes on.. or at least from what I've noticed myself.

I've recently tried my luck at securing an internship for the long summer break while being here in Singapore (mostly just so that I can gain some peace in solitude away from home, more than learning from the workforce).
It may have been wrong on my part for doing certain things wrong, but I remember being berated by my dad for sending in a résume that was outright wrong and unprofessional.
During then, I could feel a mix of emotions rummaging through my headspace - fear of even facing my dad who now probably thinks I don't have what it takes to go job-seeking in a foreign country, sadness and disgust at myself for blowing off an opportunity to "make proper use" of my break and a reason to actually stay here and relinquish a S$900 per month room rental, as well as frustration and anger over the very fact that my dad (my parents in general) would take any good opportunity possible to exert their want on me to conform to the status quo.. all in the name of fitting in.

Frankly be told, having a feed on LinkedIn like that does set off some unexplainable triggers in me, and I seriously wish there was a better way for me to explain what's actually going on.
It's unfortunate that having a professional profile on places like this one has become a requirement for securing many jobs nowadays.. and rightfully so, I honestly wish they'd do away with the need for placing in phone numbers on our CVs or résumes.
It's bad enough for people alike who are wary about scam phone calls that aren't as easily verifiable compared to a simple e-mail.

## My Thoughts on Twitter

Outside of a professional setting though, I do own a personal Instagram account that I use to keep in touch with my normie, irl connections, and the rest are a mixed bag of me being an idiot hoot.
One personal gripe I had with Facebook at one point in time was how toxic my connections became during the height of the pandemic - this was not long after the Sheraton move happened and a lot of us who voted the government before them got understandably betrayed, and also when almost everyone in the cabinet (I mean it, KJ's the only exception imo) who did absolutely nothing but clown around petty things that shouldn't matter while ignoring whatever that should matter.
I'm not kidding when even after adjusting my Facebook feed three times to prune out all the noise, it became clear that my circle of connections on Facebook felt every single need to complain in order to live their daily lives, nothing less.
In late 2021, I ceased using Facebook on the daily, leaving behind the cesspool of hatred and strife that understandably drove me nuts and possibly deteriorated my mental health to where it stands today.

I turned to Twitter, just as I was slowly marinating myself with furry art alongside exciting news about technology as a source of escapism, and maintaining my Instagram usage as for the most part, nothing much bad to me came out of there.
Fast forward over two years later, I've started to see the negativity stemming out of Twitter under Musk's leadership.
Some time in late 2021 to early 2022, AI and NFTs became the craze that so many lustful and money-hungry no-good dingbats wanted to be a part of, and as I was following primarily furry artists more than connections from the fandom at the time, it became clear as day that there were art thieves who would scrape the ends of the Internet for images to mint and then mine for more gold.
It was also during when them variation of bored apes or anything similar became more pronounced and in our faces.. remember that and the investment/videos about them?
I sure wish I could forget them.

This really understandably upset not just the artists, but also the global environment advocates who were very concerned with how much energy consumption was used up to secure the blockchain and ensure verifiability of the tokens, and some gamers who were visibly upset with Nvidia at the time who was more invested in making graphics cards that catered more for the miners than being actually used for gaming.
The fact that when Musk took over, so much upset was caused with him rigging what worked and replaced it with what didn't, as well as how tone-deaf the algorithm now works (for the last time, I said I wasn't interested in cryptocurrency investment!), Twitter has lost garner of what made its presence warranted despite being an inverse startup (in Musk's words; this I agree).

It seems like we're transitioning into a new age of social media, where the likes of Facebook and Twitter are struggling to maintain the same levels of relevancy and integrity as before, while others new platforms like Mastodon are trying to become the next ones that work better. TikTok's Shou-Zi CHEW (and the app overall) being scrutinized for alleged ties with the Chinese government, [Twitch with its recent ad rules](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/7/23752437/twitch-new-ad-rules).. the list goes on.
Right now it's almost as if wanting to connect with other people and reap the benefits of social media especially with contacts across the globe comes with surrendering your mental sanity as cost.
Remember when there wasn't a lot asked of us just to do simply that?

Back to Twitter though, at this point in time, I wouldn't really recommend anyone who hasn't been on the platform to open a new account there.
The glory days of enjoying our time there are over, no matter how toxic it was prior.. because it certainly isn't any better now.
While it's unfortunate that there are those who carry out ongoing businesses that rely on social media presence like on Twitter where engagement is key to keeping them afloat, unless you're ready for the drawbacks, I'd advice you to not be around there.. I'm sorry.

## So What's in it for Myself

With regards to LinkedIn, I have plans on deleting it one day for good.
At a time when I don't think it being around will benefit me in any sort of way, that will be the first social media presence I'll eradicate forever.
I like being unorthodox, casual, and not as stringent over how people appear at face value.
Heck, if you've talked to me about any topic similar to this before, I'd say that if I were a job interviewer, while many people would see overdressing or formal wear as a plus, I'd question whether this person has a thing to hide underneath the mask layers they've put on.
To me, overdressing in formal shows that you're a closed book and prefer not to be authentic to yourself.. to me, as hypocritical as I may sound, I absolutely detest this kind of mindset.

I've also had some reservations on whether or not to link my Twitter profile on my irl personal website and wherever I'm somewhat semi-professional.. anywhere beyond the space of me being an owl on the internet, essentially.
There may be a time when I'll unlink my Twitter profile from these areas just to make my stance clear and heard, but as for now, I'll try to not linger around there for too long and also regulate what pops up in my curated feed for myself going forward.
The Twitter algorithm just sucks at present time, and I sure hope the big poo-poos who started this cessfest soon realizes what they're doing while attempting to play god.

The recent events on social media have also warped my mindset quite a fair bit on how technology will evolve in the coming years.
When I first got into my Foundation year in Taylor's in pursuit of a Computer Science degree I'd eventually earn 4 years later, I was pretty impressed at the idea of being the groundbreakers for developing something new with hopes to help others through modernization, even if I was dead set on a teaching career at the end.
Now that it's been nearly a decade since then, I've only seen the people in this field become groundbreakers for developing something new with hopes of **getting rich** through and in midst of modernization.. call me crestfallen, disappointed, disgusted, and livid over what's going on here.
This is further compounded by some of the impressionable faces I see when I was still working as a lecturer at Taylor's with my last few batches of students, a number of whom got in mostly because of the money or had no idea what they want to do in this field.
The tech space has become fiercely harsh over the years, and not everyone is prepared for such a future ahead of them.
Rightfully so, I've noticed so many of my classmates back in undergrad who were getting so done with the field halfway through the 3 years that they just started [quiet quitting](https://www.investopedia.com/what-is-quiet-quitting-6743910).
YES, this was already a thing before it got publicized on the media, it just didn't have a name then!

Ultimately, I've decided that as soon as I graduate from my current master's degree, if I don't pursue further in academia or if nothing else in the field sparks me up as much in the decade that follows, I'll be quitting the field for good.
There's no satisfaction being gamechangers if all you're doing is contributing to whatever that's making life worse for many others in the world.
Being hungry or foolish for more can be admirable, but as soon as you get too greedy, even that famous saying Steve Jobs uttered in the day won't mean anything to those you hurt.

Also, I hope that some day, we will recover from this mad circle of hatred and do our best to make our social media presence more sunny, just like how the sun shone at my workspace while wrapping this blog post up.
If you're reading this, let's try and do our part to make our social media posts a lot more meaningful to others.
Unlike how social media puts it, there's no cost in being friendly and kind online! ^v^

Do remember to always take care, and this hoot wishes all of you well! 🦉
