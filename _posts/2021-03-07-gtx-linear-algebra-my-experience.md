It's well over a handful of weeks since I've successfully completed the Linear Algebra series created by Georgia Tech over at edX.
Simply put, I really felt great having actually gone through the series.
Dr Greg's lessons were really good and I could feel that enthusiasm in the way how he presented the lectures.
Before I continue my praise, and possibly some afterthoughts, let's mention how I ran through the course.

It was late October 2020 (probably around the 25th-27th, if I remember correctly that access usually lasts for 35 days).
I decided to pick up linear algebra while struggling to make my proposal changes (which were overdue by six months by that time), as well as handling two classes over at my alma mater (one of which had a whopping 89 students in total).
Call me crazy, but heck yeah was those decisions one of those crazy ones.. but it's also one of the few that I totally have no regrets going with!
During this time, as opposed to how edX classes used to run back then, all those entering with free access will only have a limited time to go through the course.
With USD 199 per course in the series being way too much for me to spend as a graduate student, I opted to go for the limited time audit - that meant I'd immediately have a countdown over my head before I lose my progress and access to the courses.

Personally, this is not the first online course I've enrolled into, let alone from edX or from Udemy.
In the case for edX, I typically end up not finishing the free access courses I enrol myself into due to no sense of urgency, and possibly also due to the lack of interest after a week or two from the initial "big resolutions" self.
This time, however, I was determined to pull myself together and finish the whole series up mainly due to two reasons - firstly, it's all due to this being one of those things I've procrastinated the longest (my math enthusiast self kept beating my conscience up until the end); and secondly, I was told back before I started my postgraduate studies by one of my dad's friends that linear algebra would be integral to some areas of research in computer science.
Having gone through the full series now, I can safely confirm this fact.. though to be very frank, based on what I know, not many CS students are actually keen on research, so not having a real linear algebra course as part of the syllabus was a blessing for them.
For me, however, I genuinely felt left out both as a math enthusiast and as someone aspiring to get into academia or a teaching job at the very least in higher education.

As I mentioned, despite my better judgment at the time (I really did not need another routine to bog my weekly schedule up), I took the mantle and started the series with the first course - Linear Algebra I: Linear Equations. This course has 3 modules:

1. Linear Systems and Spans
2. Solution Sets and Linear Independence
3. Linear Transforms

For the most of the early parts of this course, it felt like a self-imposed revision on what I had already gone through about linear systems - and keep in mind I procrastinated a lot during all my previous attempts.
Still, it was great that I managed to keep myself composed while going through some of the stuff I've already made myself familiar with before jumping into Linear Transforms - it was pretty interesting to learn that the geometrical transformations of lines and shapes I was learning back in school had a specific standard matrices.
From this point forward, I made it a point to literally transcribe everything I saw on the slides and copy all the exercise questions during/after attempting them.
I finished the course within roughly 4 weeks.

The next course was Linear Algebra II: Matrix Algebra. This course also has 3 modules:

1. Matrix Addition and Scalar Subtraction
2. The Invertible Matrix Theorem and Applications
3. Computer Graphics and Subspaces

I was taught basic matrix operations during my time in secondary school, so there were a few more times when I felt like I had recap sessions during the early parts of the course.
The newer topics for me include the LU Decomposition method that's used to decompose an $m \times n$ matrix into the form $ A\overrightarrow{x} = \overrightarrow{b} $, application of this decomposition method in the Leontif Model, and subspaces.
I'll admit, from here a lot of the new concepts were beginning to feel a little heavy as I have other daily commitments to tend to while making sure I make the 5-week deadline.
I can't say going forward that I still remember everything, but I do plan on revisiting these lessons from my transcribed notes along with some more exercise questions I can find in the future.

The next two modules were Linear Algebra III: Determinants and Eigenvalues, and Linear Algebra IV: Orthogonality & Symmetric Matrices and the SVD. Linear Algebra III has 3 modules:

1. Determinants
2. Markov Chains and Eigenvalues
3. Diagonalization and Page Rank

Linear Algebra IV breaks the trend of merely having 3 modules by having 5 instead:

1. Orthogonal Projections
2. Gram-Schmidt
3. Least-Squares
4. Quadratic Forms and Constrained Optimization
5. The SVD

From what I understand, Page Rank is something exclusive to Georgia Tech's Linear Algebra course as it uncovers how search engines work (specifically Google in the given examples) - being in the computing field line, I felt that this was very intriguing to know the basics of how search engines come up with its results.
The one I found that would be most useful in my research work may probably be the SVD - back when I was going through research paper after research paper to come up with my initial literature review for my proposal, I was very dependent on the publishers laying out their scheme in an algorithmic format rather than only being reliant on mathematical equations.
This definitely limited my ability to pick up and understand what I see from all the research papers I could find.
Having noticed that SVD was used quite frequently in their findings, I hope that in the future I'd have less issues understanding such research papers going forward.

Overall, Dr Greg has been a very, very enthusiastic facilitator throughout the 4 courses in the GTx Linear Algebra series.
It is quite a shame that my interaction with him has only been through words on screen and not in person, the closest being a thank-you message on Twitter thanking him for making a great series upon my completion of the whole thing altogether.
For those who've been in his classroom before, know that you'd be blessed with this enthusiasm and in-depth understanding of whatever course he may be teaching you.
He's basically one of those educators I plan on attempting to emulate whenever I make my own video lessons for my classes.
Hopefully, with experience I may be able to replicate the same enthusiasm and patience he showed all of us virtual students over at edX.

Dr Greg, if you manage to stumble upon this blog post, know that I am eternally grateful for allowing me to push one step further into something of my interests and field of work.
If there comes a chance for us to meet in person one day, I'd really love that.
Once again, thank you so very much.
You made this learning hypocrite a little more happier and wiser. üòÅ
